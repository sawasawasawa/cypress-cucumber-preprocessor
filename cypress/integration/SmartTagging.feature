Feature: Smart Tagging

  As a cucumber cypress plugin which handles Tags
  I want to allow people to select tests to run if focused
  So they can work more efficiently and have a shorter feedback loop

  Scenario: This scenario should not run if @focus is on another scenario
    Then this unfocused scenario should not run

  @focus
  Scenario: This scenario is focused and should run
    Then this focused scenario should run

  @this-tag-affects-nothing
  Scenario: This scenario should also not run
    Then this unfocused scenario should not run

  @focus
  Scenario: This scenario is also focused and also should run
    Then this focused scenario should run
